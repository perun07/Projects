#Project one will be an attempt to create a country/travel/ vacation website. Basically, someone will go to the site, search for the country. A photo of the flag will come up on the site. Some information on the country below. I also added a google maps API which, upon country search, pulls in the country location. I added a tooltips on the buttons which link directly into wikapedia (while it is technically not a third api, it also kind of it.)I had fun with the https://restcountries.eu/#api-endpoints-response-example api. Really took some work pulling out the data and posting what I wanted but In roughly got what I was hoping to get.
